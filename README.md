# Gesture Volume Control

## ðŸŽ› Gesture Volume Control

Control your system volume using hand gestures with OpenCV & MediaPipe!

### ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project enables users to control their computerâ€™s audio volume using hand gestures. By leveraging Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw, it tracks hand movements in real-time and adjusts the system volume accordingly.


### ðŸ“Œ Project Structure

HandTrackingModule.py: Contains the handDetector class with findHands() and findPosition() functions for hand tracking.

VolumeHandControl.py: Imports HandTrackingModule.py and uses its functionalities to control the system volume based on hand gestures.


### ðŸ”§ Features

âœ… Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe Hands

âœ… Adjust system volume based on hand gestures

âœ… Intuitive and contactless volume control

âœ… Uses OpenCV for video processing

âœ… Pycaw to control system volume


### ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Python

OpenCV (for video processing)

MediaPipe (for hand tracking)

Pycaw (for volume control automation)

Numpy (for numerical operations)


### ðŸš€ How It Works

The webcam captures hand movements.

MediaPipe detects hand landmarks.

The distance between the thumb and index finger determines the volume level.

Pycaw adjusts the system volume accordingly.
